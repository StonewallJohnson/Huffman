# Huffman
This project features a HuffmanEncoder and HuffmanDecoder 

The HuffmanCoder takes a text file and creates a new Huffman coded version of that file.
The HuffmanDecoder takes a file that is huffman coded by the HuffmanCoder and recreates the file using normal ASCII encoding.

To use either properly will also require the LetterData class, which functionaly acts as the nodes of the Huffman tree, and the files in the datastructs folder.
The test.java file is a simple test of the functionality of the HuffmanCoder/Decoder classes.
